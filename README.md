# Machine Learning with Python

*Tutorial Series by TechWithTim* ([Tech With Tim][1])

Welcome to the **Machine Learning with Python** tutorial series! This series teaches the fundamentals of machine learning using Python. It starts with core algorithms and progresses into more advanced topics like neural networks — giving you a strong foundation in both theory and practical implementation. ([Tech With Tim][1])

##  Overview

This series is designed to help you understand essential machine learning concepts and how to implement them in Python, using popular libraries like **scikit-learn** and tools commonly used in the industry. ([Tech With Tim][1])

##  What You’ll Learn

By completing this series, you’ll gain practical knowledge of:

* **Linear Regression**
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
* **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
* **K-Means Clustering**
* **Neural Networks**
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** ([Tech With Tim][1])

---

##  Prerequisites

⚠️ **Important:** This is *not* a beginner Python tutorial — you should already be familiar with:

* Intermediate/advanced programming concepts
* Python 3 syntax and environment setup

You should know how to work with Python scripts, install packages, and navigate basic data structures. ([Tech With Tim][1])

##  Content Outline

This series includes the following lessons:

1. **Introduction & Setup**
2. **Linear Regression (Part 1 & 2)**
3. **Saving & Training Multiple Models**
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification**
5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
6. **K-Means Clustering**
7. **Neural Networks & CNNs** ([Tech With Tim][2])

Each lesson builds on the last, teaching the algorithm’s intuition and how to apply it using Python code. ([Tech With Tim][2])

##  Getting Started

To start learning:

1. Clone the repository or download the lesson files.
2. Set up a Python 3 environment (virtualenv, conda, etc.).
3. Install required packages (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`).
4. Follow the lessons in order.
